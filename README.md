"# Warriors_Tail" 

Warriors Tail was a fan-game based on the Warriors series by Erin Hunter.

The stage shown above was made with PyGame, and only includes the very basic skeleton of what was planned.

It shows a title screen, menu, and 2D sprite based design with a moving npc and interactable bush, both with collision.
